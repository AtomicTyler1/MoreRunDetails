# Better Scout Report

## Overview

This mod enhances the end-of-run Scout Report by adding additional information and a redesigned UI. The goal is to provide clearer, more transparent run data that can be easily shared or reviewed after a run.

## Features

### Better Scout Report UI

* Replaces the default Scout Report screen shown at the end of a run with a redesigned interface.
* Presents information in a clearer and more readable layout.

### Ascent Tracking

* Displays the selected Ascent level directly on the Scout Report.
* Makes it clear which Ascent was used for the run, allowing screenshots to accurately reflect the run’s difficulty.

### Biome Progress Tracking

* Tracks when each biome is completed.
* Adds a **Campfire** section to the report to indicate biome transitions.
* Includes a **Time Spent** breakdown showing how long was spent in each section of the run.

### Configurable Keybind

* Includes a configurable keybind (default: `G`).
* Changing the keybind automatically updates the UI to reflect the new input.
