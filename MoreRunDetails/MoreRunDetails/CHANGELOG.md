# v0.1.5 - Icon Fix

- Accidentally forgot to change the default icon.

# v0.1.4 - Bug Fix

- Before if you died in an area it wouldn't get crossed out, this has been fixed.

# v0.1.3 - UI Addition

- It will now show you the Ascent you are on when the scout report shows up. This is seen just below the SCOUT REPORT title.
- It will rather show: `TENDERFOOT`, `PEAK (ASCENT 0)`, `ASCENT 1/2/...`

- Idea by @dr.yeet.man

# v0.1.2 - Bug Fix

- When you peak, the kiln would be crossed out as if you died there. That is now fixed.

# v0.1.1 - UI change

- Change Beach -> Shore, before I just used the internal name.

# v0.1.0 - Release

- Mod is released, yippee!
