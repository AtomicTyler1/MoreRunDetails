# v0.2.1 - New config

- A new config has been added to automatically open the UI, this is false by default so make sure you toggle it if you want it!

# 0.2.0 - Configs and more additions

- The timeline title also looks like the following:
    - `TIMELINE (DAY: 5) (Level_13)`, obviously with the values substituted
- 2 new configs!
    - Show Current Ascent (Default: true), hides if the run was tenderfoot or peak or ascent *_*.
   - Show Day and Level (Default: true), setting this to false will not show this new UI, this will fix localization and return back to your language for the TIMELINE text, or just disable if its too much clutter.

# v0.1.6 - Bug Fix

- 2 People calling Light Campfire at the same time would cause a duplicate entry, this has hopefully been fixed. Ping @atomictyler on the PEAK or PEAK Modding discord if you still have this bug.

# v0.1.5 - Icon Fix

- Accidentally forgot to change the default icon.

# v0.1.4 - Bug Fix

- Before if you died in an area it wouldn't get crossed out, this has been fixed.

# v0.1.3 - UI Addition

- It will now show you the Ascent you are on when the scout report shows up. This is seen just below the SCOUT REPORT title.
- It will rather show: `TENDERFOOT`, `PEAK (ASCENT 0)`, `ASCENT 1/2/...`

- Idea by @dr.yeet.man

# v0.1.2 - Bug Fix

- When you peak, the kiln would be crossed out as if you died there. That is now fixed.

# v0.1.1 - UI change

- Change Beach -> Shore, before I just used the internal name.

# v0.1.0 - Release

- Mod is released, yippee!
